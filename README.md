# 📊 Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis

This project explores and visualizes customer response data from a multi-channel marketing campaign to uncover patterns in engagement, spending, and segment-wise performance. Built using Python and Tableau, it answers key business questions like:

- Which campaigns performed best overall?
- What customer segments (age, education, marital status) were most responsive?
- How does spending behavior relate to campaign acceptance?
- Where should marketers focus future budget and effort?
